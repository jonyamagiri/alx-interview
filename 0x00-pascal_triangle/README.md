# 0x00-pascal_triangle

> This repository contains the tasks for `pascal_triangle` project and a description of what each program or function does:


## Learning Objectives

* `Pascal's triangle` is a triangular array of binomial coefficients, where the value in the i-th row and j-th column represents the binomial coefficient "i choose j", denoted as C(i, j). The values in Pascal's triangle are calculated by summing the two values directly above each number to get the value below it. The first and last numbers in each row are always 1, and each of the other numbers is the sum of the two numbers directly above it.


## Tasks

### Task: 0-pascal_triangle.py
* Create a function `def pascal_triangle(n):` that returns a list of lists of integers representing the Pascalâ€™s triangle of `n`:
[*] Returns an empty list if `n <= 0`
[*] You can assume `n` will be always an integer
