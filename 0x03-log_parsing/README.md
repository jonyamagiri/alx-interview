# 0x03. Log Parsing

> This repository contains the tasks for `Log Parsing` project and a description of what each program or function does:


## Learning Objectives

* `Log parsing` is the process of analyzing and extracting meaningful information from log files generated by various software applications or systems. Python provides several libraries and tools that can be used for log parsing, including regular expressions and built-in file handling methods.


## Tasks

### Task: 0-stats.py
* Write a script that reads `stdin` line by line and computes metrics:
- [x] Input format: `<IP Address> - [<date>] "GET /projects/260 HTTP/1.1" <status code> <file size>` (if the format is not this one, the line must be skipped)
- [x] After every 10 lines and/or a keyboard interruption (`CTRL + C`), print these statistics from the beginning:
* Total file size: `File size: <total size>`
* where `<total size>` is the sum of all previous `<file size>` (see input format above)
* Number of lines by status code:
    * possible status code: `200`, `301`, `400`, `401`, `403`, `404`, `405` and `500`
    * if a status code doesn’t appear or is not an integer, don’t print anything for this status code
    * format: `<status code>: <number>`
    * status codes should be printed in ascending order
